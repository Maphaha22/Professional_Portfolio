## 👤 About Me

I am a motivated IT graduate currently completing a **BSc in Informatics (UNISA)**, with a **National Diploma in Information Technology**.

I have worked in a SMME IT services company where I gained broad exposure across multiple areas, including:
- IT support
- Networking fundamentals
- Web development
- Cloud fundamentals
- Technical documentation and proposal support

While this environment required me to wear many hats, I am now seeking a **graduate or entry-level role** where I can gain depth, mentorship, and structured technical growth.
